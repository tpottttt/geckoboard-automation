# 🚀 Geckoboard Automation Project - Status Handoff

**Date**: June 4, 2025  
**Session End Time**: Evening  
**Next Session**: Tomorrow (fresh chat)

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Building a Playwright automation to create Geckoboard dashboards with Zendesk Support widgets. This is a proof of concept for automating dashboard creation with specific metrics.

### Target Widget Configuration:
- **Service**: Zendesk Support (not generic Zendesk)
- **Metric**: First Reply Time  
- **Time Period**: Today
- **Filter**: Solved tickets only
- **Description**: "First reply time in business hours for today's solved tickets"

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL SETUP STATUS

### ✅ COMPLETED:
- [x] Node.js project initialized with Playwright
- [x] Environment variables configured (`.env` file exists)
- [x] GitHub repository created and connected
- [x] Security: Credentials moved to `.env`, `.gitignore` configured
- [x] Dependencies installed: `playwright`, `dotenv`
- [x] Screenshots directory created for documentation

## 🤖 AUTOMATION STATUS

### LATEST WORKING SCRIPT: `src/interactive-automation.js`

**Last Test Results (June 4, 2025)**:
✅ Login: WORKING  
✅ Dashboard Creation: WORKING  
🔧 Dashboard Renaming: STUCK - 3-dots menu approach not working yet
⏸️ Widget Panel Opening: NOT TESTED (blocked by renaming)  
⏸️ Zendesk Selection: NOT TESTED (blocked by renaming)  

### 🚨 CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE:

#### 1. **Exact Selectors Added** (from HTML inspection):
```javascript
// Zendesk Support button
const zendeskSelector = 'a[data-service-name="zendesk3"].link---_b81f4, a[href*="zendesk3"]';

// First Reply Time option  
const firstReplyTimeSelector = 'span.title---_3e44:has-text("First reply time")';
```

#### 2. **Dashboard Renaming Fixed**:
- Implements 3-dots menu → "Rename" workflow
- Multiple fallback strategies
- Manual fallback options

#### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
- Fallback selectors for each step
- User interaction prompts when automation fails
- Comprehensive screenshot documentation

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### Issue #1: Zendesk Support Selection
**Status**: User reported "nothing happened" when clicking  
**Solution Applied**: Added exact HTML selectors + longer wait times  
**Next Steps**: Test the improved selectors from HTML inspection

### Issue #2: Dashboard Renaming (BLOCKING ISSUE)
**Status**: STUCK - 3-dots menu approach implemented but not working  
**Problem**: Automation can't find the 3-dots menu button automatically
**User Report**: Still getting stuck at renaming step during final test
**Next Steps**: Need to debug the 3-dots menu selector or try alternative approach

## 🧭 NEXT SESSION ROADMAP

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. **Test Updated Script**: Run `node src/interactive-automation.js`
2. **Verify Zendesk Selection**: Ensure new selectors work properly
3. **Complete Widget Configuration**: 
   - First Reply Time selection
   - Set time period to "today"  
   - Add filter for solved tickets
4. **Dashboard Cleanup**: Test cleanup functionality

### COMMANDS TO RUN:
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/taylorpotter/Desktop/Cursor/PlayWright

# Test the automation
node src/interactive-automation.js

# If issues, run simple check first
node src/simple-check.js
```

## 📸 VISUAL DEBUGGING APPROACH
The automation takes screenshots at each step:
- `interactive-01-login-page.png`
- `interactive-02-credentials-filled.png`
- `interactive-03-after-login-attempt.png`
- etc.

**Check `screenshots/` folder** for visual debugging info.

## 🔄 AUTOMATION FEATURES

### Safety Features:
- **Prefix Protection**: Only creates/deletes dashboards with `AUTO-TEST-` prefix
- **Session ID**: Unique timestamps prevent conflicts
- **Interactive Prompts**: User confirms each major step
- **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple selectors tried automatically

### Current Session Pattern:
1. Login to Geckoboard
2. Cleanup any existing `AUTO-TEST-` dashboards
3. Create new dashboard with session ID: `AUTO-TEST-{timestamp}-Widget-Test`
4. Add Zendesk Support widget
5. Configure First Reply Time metric
6. Set time period to "today"
7. Add filter for solved tickets
8. Cleanup on completion

## 🎓 USER LEARNING OBJECTIVES
The user (taylor.potter@therealbrokerage.com) wants to:
- Learn web automation with Playwright
- Understand GitHub version control workflow  
- Build practical automation for work (Geckoboard/Zendesk integration)
- Document the development process for future reference

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Login Fails:
- Check `.env` file exists and has correct credentials
- Verify network connection to Geckoboard
- Run `node src/simple-check.js` for basic connectivity test

### If Selectors Fail:
- Browser window stays open for manual inspection
- Take manual screenshots of current state
- User can provide HTML inspection data
- Fallback: manual clicking with automation prompts

### If Cleanup Needed:
- Automation only affects `AUTO-TEST-` prefixed dashboards
- User's real dashboards are protected
- Manual cleanup possible through Geckoboard UI
